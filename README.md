## Introduction
This project models European vanilla options, digital options, and path-dependent options. It includes various pricing methods and demonstrates fundamental concepts in financial engineering.

## Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Features
- **Black-Scholes Model**: Pricing for call and put options.
- **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Model**: Binomial tree method for option pricing.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: For pricing path-dependent options.
- **Options Types**: Supports European vanilla options, digital options, and Asian options.
